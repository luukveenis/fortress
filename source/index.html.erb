      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      I'm a software developer currently living in beautiful Victoria, BC. I'm
      a few weeks away from completing my Computer Science (B.Sc.) degree at
      the University of Victoria (UVic). My favourite things are programming,
      animals, and metal. I write as much code as I can, listen to as much music
      as I can, and spend as much time as possible with my pets. I love learning
      new things and am always looking for a challenge.

  <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

      <p>
      The University of Victoria has an excellent coop program that helps place
      students in relevant work positions throughout their studies. Over my 4.5
      years here, I've had the opportunity to work with some great people in
      various positions.
      </p>
      <p>
      For my first coop position I provided in-house IT support for a local tech
      startup of approximately 70 people. I did everything from onboarding new
      employees and setting up their workstations to providing group tutorials
      for new software being used internally. For my second position I worked at
      the IBM lab in Victoria. I spent most of my time writing automated tests
      for smoe of their legacy products. The test suite was written in Java using
      Selenium Webdriver.

      My last coop placement was at a local tech startup called Stembolt. I feel
      confident saying that I learned more there than I have in most of my time at
      UVic. During my time there I worked as a full-stack web developer implementing
      features for eCommerce applications built using the Ruby on Rails framework.
      I gained a ton of experience with all the relevant tools including: Ruby,
      Rails, HTML, SASS, JS, etc. All my work was constantly peer reviewed which
      helped me learn better development practices and taught me to be more
      critical of the code that I write.
